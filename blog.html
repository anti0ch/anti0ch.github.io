				<p><b>02/07/18:</b> Tons of thanks to <a href="http://www.aiweirdness.com">Janelle Shane</a> for helping me out with optimizing my tensorflow char-rnn hyperparameters. In her honor, check out these silly turtle names that the neural network produced,
					and thanks to my friend Ellie for suggesting turtles and providing the website with every single turtle ever!</p>

				</p>

				<p>There weren’t as many turtles as I had hoped, but the uniformity in the names (it helps that nearly every turtle name ends in ‘turtle’) meant that my dataset ended up being reasonably sufficient. I was able to get turtle names that actually sounded
					within the realm of possibility, less realistic turtles, some particularly alarming turtles, and some non-turtles! (How did a porpoise slip in there?) </p>
					<p> <center><img src="images/peopleturt.png"
						  width="40%" height="40%"></center> <br> Most interestingly the neural net tried to guess what a reasonable name for a person might be,
					extrapolating from all of the entries in the turtle database that were like “So-and-so’s turtle”. Some of the names it came up with for hypothetical people who might have had a turtle named after them were pretty decent, others, not so much.</p>
